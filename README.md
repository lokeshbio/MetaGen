# MetaGen
All metagenomic analysis related codes and programs.

Below are the explanations of what each of the file is about!

### Metagenomic_analysis

This file contains basically all the code that I have used/use in general to analyse metagenomic sequencing projects! This has all the information starting from raw sequence reads, quality filtering/trimming, assembly up until binning.


### Loki1_1k

This file contains the information of how you use just the 'mmgenome' package to bin your interested genomes! the code for generating files for this script is actually part in the "metagenomic_analysis.md" file.

### Phylogentic_analysis

This file contains the simple code to do clustering and building a phylogentic tree based on the protein sequences you want to analyse.

HAPPY HAPPY CODING :)
